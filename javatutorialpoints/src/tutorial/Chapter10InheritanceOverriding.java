/*
Inheritance
- class acquires properties, hierarchial order
- super/base/parent v. sub/derived/child
**use key words "extends" to implement relationship inheritance

**use key word "super" to invoke super class constructor from subclass

**For parametrized constructor in super class, it MUST be declared in subclass and called upon by super() in block
**Also remember parametrized constructor replaces default unless explicitly declare default

IS-A and HAS-A:
- pretty self-explanatory

Types of Inheritance:
- Single : 1 parents - 1 sub
- Multi Level : 1 parent to 1 sub to 1 sub of the sub
- Hierarchical : 1 parents, 2 subs
- Multiple : 2 parents, 1 sub connected to both

**implements for interfaces

Overriding:
: ability to override a superclass method IF the method is not final

**Static Methods, Final methods, and Constructors CANNOT be overridden (static can be "re-declared");

Virtual Method:
- when an object is declared and is referred to the super class but is an object of thesubclass, only the overridden methods within the subclass will be used
