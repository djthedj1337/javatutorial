Basic Review of Java:
- Object:  states + behaviors, instance of a class
- Class: template/blueprint of objects, contains behaviors and states
- Methods: behaviors
- Instance Variables: set of instance created by values

Syntax:
- Case Sensitivity: "Hello" and "hello" are not the same
- Class Names: First Letter of each word is capitalized
- Method Names: First Word lowercase, then capitalized for sequential words
- Program File Name : Matched with class then followed by '.java'

**Names are essentially identifiers (MUST began with either A to Z, a to z, $, or _)

Java Modifiers:
- Access Modifiers: Default, public, protected, private
- Non-Access Modifiers: Final, abstract, strictpf

Java Variables:
- Local, Class (static), Instance (non-static)

Java Enums and arrays are a thing

Inheritance:
- classes can be derived from classes, reusability, superclass is exisitng class and subclass is derived class

Interfaces:
- contracts between objects and how to communicate with each other
- defines methods a subclass should use, implemtntation of methods up to subclass
