** Four Fundamental Concepts of OO = Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation

Polymorphism:
- object's ability to take on many forms
- parent class reference used to refer to a child class object
- pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymoyphic

Abstraction:
- quality of dealing with ideas
- process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only functionality is shown
- "information on what the object does and NOT how it does it"

Abstract Class:
- contains "abstract" keyword
- can contain abstract methods (without body)
- containing one abstract method = must declare class abstract
- if inherit an abstract class, must provide all implementations to all ABSTRACT methods in it

Encapsulation:
- wrapping data and code acting on data/methods as a single unit
- variables hidden from other classes and used by other methods (called "data hiding")
