/*
Advantages using Java:
- Multithreaded: programs perform multiple tasks simultaneously
- Interpreted: byte code not stored anywhere and translated "on the fly", rapid and incremental, light weight rpocess (linking)
- High Performance: Just-In-Time compilers allow high performance
- Distributed: designed for internet distributed environment
- Dynamic: More dynamic compared to C/C++, adapt to evolving environment, verify and resolve on run-time due to increased info

Features of Java "Write Once, Run Anywhere"
- Object Oriented: easily extended since everything is based on Object model
- Platform Independent: compiled into platform independent byte code instead of platform specific machine (interpreted by JVM on any platform)
- Simple: OOP easy to master, easy to learn
- Secure: Authentication techniques based on public-key encryption
- Architecture-Neutral: compiler creates architecture-neutral object file format, compiled code executable on many processors
- Portable: compiler written in ANSI C with clean portability boundary, architecture neutral and no dependent implementation
- Robust: compile time error checking and run time checking to lessen errors
- Multithreaded: perform multiple tasks simultaneously
